**Description**
This is my Netflix clone project, designed to mimic the look and feel of the popular streaming platform. This project includes a home page showcasing movies and TV shows in a grid format, a menu with dropdown options, and hover effects for interactive browsing.

**Features**
Home Page: Displays a layout similar to Netflix's, with rows of movie thumbnails for various categories like "Trending," "Top Rated," and "Watch Again."
Dropdown Menu: An interactive menu with dropdown options for easy navigation across different sections.
Hover Effects: Each movie or show thumbnail features hover effects, giving the user an immersive browsing experience.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the layout, grid system, and hover effects.

**Future Improvements**
Add a video player page to simulate the streaming experience.
Implement search functionality to allow users to find movies or shows.
Add more interactivity and animations to enhance the user experience.
